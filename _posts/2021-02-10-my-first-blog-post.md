My name is Saahith Matam and I am currently a Junior at UTD, I have always had an urge to learn more than the pace at 
which I am going at school. I always pick up a variety of books and begin reading in order to gain more knowledge about things that have 
yet to be uncovered. When I come across something interesting I can not rest until my curiosity has been fulfilled. The topics being 
discussed in the description of this class have caught my eye as I would like to learn more about project management, and a more insight 
into how social media connects our society. I have experience in project management as I have worked on many self-projects with my roommates 
on just trying to discover something new. I believe getting a deeper insight on how things coordinate in an actual project will allow me to gain
a deeper understanding on how to approach my next venture. I will bring my positive attitude and my curiosity to excel above and beyond to the table.
